# JCoreFX
 Microkernel architecture pattern for JavaFX application.  
This library want to provide all necessary utilities for creating a modular software (management of : layout, data, service, modules, notification, scenes, etc).  
Add-ons will be progressively added.

## Platform
- [x] Windows
- [x] Linux
- [x] Mac

## Technologies used
  - Language : [Java 11](https://www.java.com)
  - GUI : [JavaFX 11.0.1](https://openjfx.io/)
  - Compilation : [Gradle 5.4.1](https://gradle.org/)
  - Libaries :
    - [json-simple](https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple)
    - [commons lang 3](https://github.com/apache/commons-lang)

## Features
  
  - Layout management
  - Module management
  - Service management
  - Link management
  - Save management
  - Data management
  - Log management

## Next steps in progress
  - Finalize JavaFX 2.0
  - Amelioration of data management
  - Creation of documentation / wiki
  - Creation of basic example project (paint software) for demonstration of JCoreFX.

## JCoreFX's story

JCoreFX's code (version 1.0) is the kernel of a software realized by :
  - [VianneyDoleans](https://github.com/VianneyDoleans)  
  - [ValMont13](https://github.com/ValMont13)  
  - Another person who wants to be anonymous    
  
For some reasons, this software was restarted from zero with another language / technologies.  
With approval of my teammates, I deleted all the parts that were not part of kernel, and refactor the rest.  
JCoreFX 1.0 is the result of this step.  
I will transform this kernel into a library, and continue to develop it, under the name of JCoreFX.

## Status

The project cannot be used for the moment. JCoreFX's code was, originally, embedded in a software. It wasn't a library.  
It will be fix it for JCoreFX 2.0.
